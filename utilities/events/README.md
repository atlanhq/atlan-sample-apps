## Features
- Simulates event-driven workflows
- Real-time workflow status tracking
- Integration with Temporal for workflow management
- Demonstrates async and sync activities in a workflow
- Example of basic workflow implementation

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)
- [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli)
- Atlan instance access and API key

### Installation Guides
- [macOS Setup Guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk/blob/main/docs/docs/setup/MAC.md)
- [Linux Setup Guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk/blob/main/docs/docs/setup/LINUX.md)
- [Windows Setup Guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk/blob/main/docs/docs/setup/WINDOWS.md)

## Quick Start

1. **Download required components:**
   ```bash
   uv run poe download-components
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables (see below)**

3. **Start dependencies (in separate terminal):**
   ```bash
   uv run poe start-deps
   ```

4. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

### Access the Application

Once the application is running:

- **Temporal UI**: Access the Temporal Web UI at `http://localhost:8233` (or your Temporal UI address) to monitor workflow executions.
- **Frontend**: Access the Frontend UI at `http://localhost:8000`

To see the events flow - 
1. Click "Start Workflow" on the frontend UI at `http://localhost:8000`
2. Go to the temporal dashboard to see that a new workflow of the type `WorkflowTriggeredByUI` has started
3. Wait for this workflow to finish, once finished, a new workflow will be triggered by the `workflow_end` event of this workflow of type `WorkflowTriggeredByEvent`
