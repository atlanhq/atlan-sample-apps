## Features
- Simulates event-driven workflows
- Real-time workflow status tracking
- Integration with Temporal for workflow management
- Demonstrates async and sync activities in a workflow
- Example of basic workflow implementation

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> To run, first see the [main project README](../README.md) for prerequisites.

### Run the Events Application

```bash
uv run main.py
```

### Access the Application

Once the application is running:

- **Temporal UI**: Access the Temporal Web UI at `http://localhost:8233` (or your Temporal UI address) to monitor workflow executions.
- **Frontend**: Access the Frontend UI at `http://localhost:8000`

To see the events flow - 
1. Click "Start Workflow" on the frontend UI at `http://localhost:8000`
2. Go to the temporal dashboard to see that a new workflow of the type `WorkflowTriggeredByUI` has started
3. Wait for this workflow to finish, once finished, a new workflow will be triggered by the `workflow_end` event of this workflow of type `WorkflowTriggeredByEvent`
