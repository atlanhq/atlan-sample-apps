# App Overview

Help the developer setup the development environment for running the sample apps.

## Step 1: If not already done, setup the development environment for running the sample apps.

- [setup.md](./setup.md)

## Step 2: Follow the app's README for specific setup:

- Each app has its own `README.md` with complete setup instructions
- Based on the requested app, follow the instructions in the README to setup the app.

## Step 3: Verify the app is running correctly

- Verify if the dependencies have started and the app is running correctly
- In case of any issues starting the dependencies, try stopping the dependencies and starting them again.
- In case of any issues running the app, follow the instructions in the README to run the app.

## Important Notes
- Do not install any other dependencies or tools as part of the setup process unless explicitly requested by the developer.
