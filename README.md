## Quick Start

Each sample app is **self-contained** with its own dependencies and setup instructions. This makes it easy to run individual apps without installing unnecessary dependencies.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-sample-apps.git
   cd atlan-sample-apps
   ```

2. **Navigate to any sample app directory:**
   ```bash
   cd quickstart/hello_world  # or any other app directory
   ```

3. **Follow the app's README for specific setup:**
   Each app has its own `README.md` with complete setup instructions

OR

4. Using **[Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/) (v1.6+)**, you can use slash commands to quickly set up and run sample apps, example:

```
help me /setup and run the mysql /app
```

This will automatically handle the environment setup and app initialization for you!


> [!NOTE]
> - Each app has its own environment variables and configuration requirements
> - Always check the README.md file in each app directory for specific instructions
> - When switching between apps, clear your browser cache to avoid cached static files (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>)


### Sample Apps

| Sample App | Description | Directory |
|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 🤖 AI Giphy | An AI-powered application that allows sending GIFs via email using natural language | [quickstart/ai_giphy](./quickstart/ai_giphy) |
| 👋 Hello World | A basic example demonstrating the fundamental concepts of the Atlan Application SDK along with the use of both async and sync activities in a workflow. | [quickstart/hello_world](./quickstart/hello_world) |
| 🤡 Giphy | An application that allows sending GIFs via email using Python and Temporal workflows | [quickstart/giphy](./quickstart/giphy) |
| 🗃️ MySQL | An application that extracts metadata from a MySQL database and transforms it into a standardized format | [connectors/mysql](./connectors/mysql) |
| 📈 Anaplan | An application that extracts metadata from an Anaplan instance and transforms it into a standardized format. Intended as an example on how to build apps for non-sql data sources using the Application SDK | [connectors/anaplan](./connectors/anaplan) |
| 📈 Workflows Observability | An application that retrieves and logs workflow run metadata from Atlan | [utilities/workflows_observability](./utilities/workflows_observability) |
| 📝 Asset Description Reminder | An application that helps maintain data quality by reminding asset owners to add descriptions to their assets through Slack messages                    | [utilities/asset_descriptor_reminder](./utilities/asset_descriptor_reminder) |
| ⏰ Freshness Monitor          | An application that monitors the freshness of assets in Atlan and sends notifications when assets become stale                                          | [utilities/freshness_monitor](./utilities/freshness_monitor)                 |


## Debugging

- If you use [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) IDE, the repository has a launch configuration setup; just update the app directory and run the launch configuration.
- For example, the configuration is defaulted to run the MySQL app, you can click on the "Run App + Deps" launch configuration to run the app along with the dependent services.


## Build Docker images

You can build Docker images for any app in this repo using the provided `Dockerfile`.

### Setup the App Directory

Copy the `Dockerfile` from the root directory to the app directory (example: `connectors/mysql`, `quickstart/ai_giphy`, etc.):

```bash
cp Dockerfile ./connectors/mysql/
```

Navigate to the app directory (for example `connectors/mysql`, `quickstart/ai_giphy`, etc.):

```bash
cd connectors/mysql
```

### Build the Docker image
From the app directory (for example `connectors/mysql`, `quickstart/ai_giphy`, etc.):

```bash
docker build --no-cache -f ./Dockerfile -t app-name:latest .
```

### Run the Docker container:

**If your Temporal service is running on the host machine:**
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -e ATLAN_WORKFLOW_HOST=host.docker.internal -e ATLAN_WORKFLOW_PORT=7233 --user 1000:1000 app-name
```

**If your Temporal service is running elsewhere (remote server/container):**
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e ATLAN_WORKFLOW_HOST=<your-temporal-host> -e ATLAN_WORKFLOW_PORT=<your-temporal-port> --user 1000:1000 app-name
```
*Replace `<your-temporal-host>` and `<your-temporal-port>` with your actual Temporal service hostname/IP and port.*
