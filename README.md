Sample apps built using [Atlan Application SDK](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk)

## Usage

### Setting up your environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atlanhq/atlan-sample-apps.git
   cd atlan-sample-apps
   ```

2. Follow the setup instructions for your platform:
   - [macOS Setup Guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk/blob/main/docs/docs/setup/MAC.md)
   - [Linux Setup Guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk/blob/main/docs/docs/setup/LINUX.md)
   - [Windows Setup Guide](https://github.com/atlanhq/application-sdk/blob/main/docs/docs/setup/WINDOWS.md)

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv sync --all-groups
   ```

4. Download required components:
   ```bash
   uv run poe download-components
   ```

5. Start the dependencies (in a separate terminal):
   ```bash
   uv run poe start-deps
   ```

6. That loads all required dependencies. To run a sample, you just run the command in the main terminal. For example:
   ```bash
   cd hello_world
   uv run main.py
   ```
