# 📡 Workflows Observability App

A robust application that retrieves and logs workflow run metadata from Atlan. Built with the Atlan Application SDK and Temporal for highly observable and reliable operations.

## Features

- Scheduled fetching of Atlan workflow run data
- Supports filtering by date and run status
- Real-time tracking via Temporal UI
- Flexible output options

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> To run, first see [README.md](../README.md) for environment setup and prerequisites.

### Run the Observability Application

Launch the application from the root:

```bash
uv run main.py
```

Set up the following env variables:
```bash
export ATLAN_BASE_URL=https://tenant.atlan.com
export ATLAN_API_KEY="..."
```

### Access the Application
-   **Web Interface**: Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port configured for `APP_HTTP_PORT`).
-   **Temporal UI**: Access the Temporal Web UI at `http://localhost:8233` (or your Temporal UI address) to monitor workflow executions.

## Workflow Process
1. Initialization: Starts with reading configuration (selectedDate, outputType).
2. Configuration Retrieval: Uses the get_workflow_args activity to fetch input parameters from a state store.
3. Calculates the time window from the current time to selectedDate
4. Fetches all workflow runs with status SUCCESS or FAILED
5. Stores result JSON in /tmp/workflows/<date>/<status>/ if outputType == "Local"
6. Completion: Logs a summary and exits gracefully.
