# Mine Extractor App

Configure and run metadata mining to enrich crawled data with insights, profiling, and lineage information.

## Prerequisites

Ensure successful crawling, mining permissions, compute resources, and data sampling access are configured.

## Mining Configuration

Configure basic mining settings including mode, parallel processing, workers, and resource allocation.

## Data Profiling

Analyze data quality through column profiling, automated quality checks, and pattern detection.

## Lineage Discovery

Discover data relationships through query log analysis, ETL process discovery, and cross-system lineage mapping.

## Usage Analytics

Analyze access patterns and calculate popularity scores for data assets based on usage metrics.

## Semantic Enrichment

Automatically classify data and map technical assets to business glossary terms.

## Custom Mining Rules

Define and execute custom mining rules for specific organizational requirements.

## Mining Workflows

Configure sequential or parallel mining workflows to optimize processing efficiency.

## Performance Optimization

Implement sampling strategies and caching to improve mining performance and resource utilization.

## Monitoring and Alerts

Monitor mining metrics and configure alerts for performance issues and quality thresholds.

## Running Mining

Execute mining manually or monitor progress using command-line tools and status checks.

## Results and Insights

Generate profile reports, view data quality dashboards, and visualize lineage relationships.

## Troubleshooting

Resolve common issues like memory errors, slow performance, and incomplete results using diagnostic tools.

## Next Steps

Review mining results, configure automated monitoring, set up schedules, and explore advanced analytics.

## Advanced Topics

Integrate machine learning, develop custom profilers, implement real-time mining, and enable cross-platform mining.
