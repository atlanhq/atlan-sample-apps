# Crawl Extractor App

This guide provides instructions for configuring and running metadata crawling from your [EXTRACTOR_APP_NAME] instance.

## Prerequisites

Ensure connector is configured, network connectivity is verified, and required permissions are granted.

## Asset Discovery

Configure which schemas, tables, and columns to include or exclude during the crawling process.

## Crawling Modes

Choose between full crawl (complete extraction), incremental crawl (changes only), or selective crawl (specific assets).

## Scheduling

Set up automated crawling schedules using frequency-based or cron-based configurations.

## Performance Optimization

Configure parallel processing, memory management, and network settings for optimal crawling performance.

## Data Profiling

Enable basic or advanced data profiling to collect statistics and quality metrics during crawling.

## Monitoring and Logging

Set up metrics collection and logging configuration for tracking crawl progress and troubleshooting.

## Error Handling

Configure retry policies and error recovery mechanisms to handle failed operations gracefully.

## Validation and Quality Checks

Validate extracted metadata completeness, accuracy, and consistency with configurable quality thresholds.

## Running the Crawl

Execute crawls manually or monitor progress using command-line tools and status checks.

## Post-Crawl Activities

Verify crawl results, validate metadata accuracy, and optimize future crawl configurations.

## Troubleshooting

Diagnose common issues like slow performance, memory problems, and connection errors with diagnostic commands.

## Next Steps

Configure mining to enrich metadata, review crawled assets in Atlan catalog, and set up ongoing monitoring.

## Advanced Configuration

Explore custom extractors, API integration, event-driven crawling, and multi-instance crawling for complex use cases.
